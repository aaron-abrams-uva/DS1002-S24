        "In finance, CAPM is a single-factor regression model used for analyzing (and predicting) excess stock returns. There are better, more accurate models, but it has its uses. For example, the *market beta* is a useful output which has something to do with the risk of particular investments.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Read [this brief synopsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model) of CAPM.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't worry if you don't understand all the terminology.\n",
        "Look for a moment at the main formula (in the \"Formula\" section).  For us that formula will look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{aligned}\n",
        "E(R_A) = R_f + \\beta_A (E(R_{SP}) - R_f)\n",
        "\\end{aligned}\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notes on the symbols in this formula:\n",
        "- The formula is used to estimate $E(R_A)$.  The $E$ here stands for the expected value, and $R_A$ is the rate of return of the investment $A$.\n",
        "- To use this formula, you therefore need to know the values of the other variables.\n",
        "- The variable $R_f$ is the \"risk-free rate,\" which is the amount of return you can get on an investment that has zero risk, like say a bank account.\n",
        "This quantity changes over time but for our purposes we can treat it as a constant.  It is hard-coded into the code below.  Make sure you see where this variable occurs in the formula above.\n",
        "- In this assignment the variable $R_{SP}$ is a measure of the rate of return of the overall market.  (The $E$ on the right side also means expected value.)\n",
        "- The variable $\\beta_A$ measures something about the relative risk of the investment A, relative to the overall market.  The technical objective of this assignment will be to compute $\\beta_A$ below, and then to examine how sensitive it is to the specific data.\n",
        "- The value you get for $\\beta_A$ will be a number.  If it is greater than 1, it means (*very roughly*) that the investment A is more volatile than the overall market.  If it is less than 1, it means that the investment is less volatile than the overall market.  But **do not take this too seriously!** In particular see all the caveats at the wikipedia page.\n",
        "- The A investment in our example is an individual stock (Apple).\n",
