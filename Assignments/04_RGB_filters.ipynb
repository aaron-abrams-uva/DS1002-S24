Remember, a photo is a 3d array whose first two dimensions are the height and width measured in pixels, and the third dimension is an `[R, G, B]` array.  To red-filter the photo means to keep only the `R` values, and to change all the `G` and `B` values to zeros.\n",
        "- Similarly define a second function that green-filters a photo, and a third function that blue-filters a photo.\n",

        "(6) a version with G and B values but no red.  \n",
        "The images should be clearly labeled.\n",
        "- finally, as a check, the code should verify (using a logical test, not by visually comparing) that the original image is identical to the image obtained by combining the red-, green-, and blue- filtered images into one image.\n",

        "6.  Also, please make your code neat and well-documented.  Your grade will be based mainly on the code performing correctly, but there will also be points for neat, well-documented code and points for effective use of programming principles.\n",
