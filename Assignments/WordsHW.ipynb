        "Tip:  there is a way to go back and forth between letters and numbers.  The `ord()` function takes characters to integers, and the `chr()` function takes integers back to characters.  Specifically, the (lower case) alphabetic characters are encoded with integers starting at 97.  So if you type `ord('a')` the output will be `97`.  If you type `chr(98)` the output will be `'b'`.  The way I solved the bonus problem, this tip was useful.  (See also problem 6.)\n",
